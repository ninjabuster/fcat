# FATCAT

A firewall testing tool

Fcat allows you to spin up multiple ports at once and then test whether you can connect to these ports from another host.

Fcat allows a range of ports to be passed as an option. This range will then be run as a loop and a new TCP port opened up for each port within the range.

Fcat can also be run in a client mode, to test connectivity to your ports.
